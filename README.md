# Group 1's Rock, Paper & Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game implemented in Python using turtle graphics. Two players compete by choosing Rock, Paper, or Scissors. The game tracks the score and round count. The `choose` function records choices and checks the round result. The `check_round` function displays choices, updates scores, and increments the round count. Players use specific keys to make their choices. Player 1 uses 'A', 'S', and 'D', while Player 2 uses '4', '5', and '6'.
